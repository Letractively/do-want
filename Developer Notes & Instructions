We're absolutely thrilled that you're on board. Or that you even just want to poke around.Or whatever. Welcome.

Do Want requires PHP5, MySQL, some sort of webserver, and a modern web browser.

There's a file included called "wishlistDB.sql". Make a new database and run this SQL in it and you should have everything you need to get started. You'll also need to look at config.php
Set the database, username, and password

The default user passwords are hashed using MD5 and are "password".

As of this writing, there are lots of incomplete features, bugs, etc. We're organizing too. So swing by the group and the project to get something to work on. If you can't find anything or have questions, post to the group.


Thanks again!
The other Do Want Developers.
